Q1) What is your understanding of Blockchain? 
Ans) Blockchain is increasing connection of different blocks witholding data and hash of 
previous block and these blocks of data cannot be modified or deleted, and also connected 
chronologically. Blockchain is formed by mix of two technologies i.e decentralised distributed 
database and cryptography. 
 
Q2) What is the core problem Blockchain is going to solve? 
Ans) The core problem Blockchain is going to solve is the dependency and placing trust on third 
party to store and secure data. With implementation of Blockchain, there is no data loss or 
manipulation. 
 
Q3) What are the few features Blockchain will give you? 
Ans)  
● Verifiability 
● Prevention of data loss 
● Tamper proof 
● Unchangeable 
● Immutable 
 
Q4) What all things does a block contain? 
Ans) 
● Block number 
● Transaction Records 
● Previous block hash 
● Mining key 
 
Q5) How is verifiability has been attained? 
Ans) Verifiability has been attained by comparing the signature of the block of a peer with 
signature of the same block of other peers. If the signature matches then the data in present 
and previous blocks is same.
